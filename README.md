# Heart Disease ML Rules

## Overview

Welcome to the `heart-disease-ml-rules` repository! This project focuses on using association rule mining to analyze heart disease data and identify patterns that could help in predicting heart disease. The analysis leverages machine learning techniques, particularly association rules, to uncover insights from a dataset of heart disease patients.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to apply association rule mining techniques to a heart disease dataset. By identifying frequently occurring patterns and relationships among various attributes, this project aims to enhance the understanding of factors contributing to heart disease and improve prediction models.

## Features

- **Association Rule Mining**: Utilizes algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth to extract rules from the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the results of the association rules and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `heart.csv`, which includes the following attributes:

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain (4 types)
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Serum Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Fasting blood sugar (1 = > 120 mg/dl, 0 = <= 120 mg/dl)
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results**: Electrocardiographic results (3 types)
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exercise-Induced Angina**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Oldpeak**: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (3 types)
